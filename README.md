## Blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/meteor-blog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/meteor-blog)

This Meteor package gives you a basic, out-of-the-box blog at `/blog`. We wanted a
way to add a blog to an existing app without running another dyno or server for
a meteor-based blog.

Example instance: [http://differential.com/blog](http://differential.com/blog)

See full [documentation](http://github.differential.com/meteor-blog/).
